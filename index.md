## Site overview
This website provides convenient access to all the standard protocols and procedures used by my group at the [PennVet CHMI](http://www.hostmicrobe.org).  If you're a member of my lab, then clicking on the "Edit me" button above (and on each page) will take you to GitHub where you can collaboratively edit any protocol page.  This wiki-style approach gives us a central place to develop our lab protocols.  If you're not part of CHMI, no worries, you can still peruse the site to see our protocols.  Comments and feedback are welcome!

## Costs
CHMI does not charge for labor (I know, I know, we're awesome).  We do, however, charge for consumables and apply a $300 run fee to each use of our sequencer, which helps offset the cost of our annual service contract on the machine.  To avoid unnecessary administrative overhead, **we ask that you purchase your own consumables for any work done with CHMI**.  Of course, we can guide you on what exactly to purchase.  See our [CHMI invoice template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nbye8xRZTtBthhm7E-KuhEXBz2E3VvOG1lmTpNpGJMA/edit?usp=sharing) for a detailed list of charges.
