As much as possible, we use R for managing, analyzing and plotting data.  This preference is largely motivated by the excellent community support for R, the exceptional RStudio interface for interacting with R, and the growing number of bioinformatics tools within the [bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/) suite of applications.

Although we frequently use RStudio on our personal computers, it is useful to have access to a server version of RStudio, particularly when your work requires more computing power.  If you have an account on our Linux cluster, then you already have access to RStudio, without having to install any additional software.  Click [**here**](http://130.91.255.137:8787) to access our RStudio server directly in your web browser.  Login with the same credentials you use to access the linux machine.  Feel free to customize your RStudio server by installing any packages needed for your work.
