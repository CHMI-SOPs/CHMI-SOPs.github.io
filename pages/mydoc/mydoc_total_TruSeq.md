# Day 1

## Documentation
[TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation Guide](https://support.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-support/documents/documentation/chemistry_documentation/samplepreps_truseq/truseqstrandedmrna/truseq-stranded-mrna-sample-prep-guide-15031047-e.pdf). This method makes a cDNA library of the polyadenylated mRNA in your eukaryotic samples of interest.

## What you'll need for Day 1

{% include important.html content="The following items are included in the Illumina kit" %}

* RNA purification beads (These are the oligo dT beads) (bring these to room temperature before use)
* Bead washing buffer
* Bead binding buffer
* Fragment prime finish mix
* First strand synthesis (in a brown tube)
* Second strand marking mix
* Resuspension buffer

{% include important.html content="The following items are NOT included with the Illumina kit and must be purchased separately" %}

* RNase-free water
* Magnetic plate for a 96-well tray
* 96-well trays
* 80% ethanol (make this fresh the day of use)
* Superscript II (Invitrogen)
* AMPureXP beads (Beckman-Coulter)

## A few important comments before you start

{% include callout.html content="
- We use the Low Sample ‘LS’ protocol as we are typically working with fewer than 48 samples at a time  
- The recommended starting amount of total RNA is 100 ng - 4 ug, but we usually try to stay away from the extreme ends of this spectrum.  
- The lowest input of RNA we have successfully used in this protocol is 70 ng.  
- Split this protocol into two days, stopping on the first day after you have double stranded cDNA. On second day, do the A-tailing, adapter ligation, PCR, cleanup, and quality control steps.  
- For 12 samples, you will need approximately 6-7 hours on the first day, and 6-7 hours the second day.  
- Keep all reagents on ice unless otherwise stated.  
- We typically remove the reagents from storage during an incubation period in the previous step.  
- Have the beads at room temperature at least 30 minutes prior to use.  
- Aliquot the reagents that arrive in large quantities (such as the resuspension buffer and the bead washing buffer) into 2 mL Eppendorf tubes.  
- We do not perform any of the in-line controls.  
- We do not use the plate barcode stickers that come with the kit.  
- Use only filter pipette tips and clean your area so it is free of RNases.  
- Ensure that the AMPureXP beads are mixed well immediately prior to use.  
- There are many mixing steps in this protocol - I frequently use a multi-channel pipette to help speed up this process, particularly if many libraries are being prepared.  
- We use a Tapestation or a BioAnalyzer to assay the input RNA quality. Ribosomal integrity numbers of 7 and higher are preferred.  
- We quantify the input RNA using a Qubit fluorometer." type="primary" %}
