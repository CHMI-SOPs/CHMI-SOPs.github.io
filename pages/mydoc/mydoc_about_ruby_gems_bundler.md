## What sequencing hardware do you have?

Jekyll runs on Ruby, a programming language. You have to have Ruby on your computer in order to run Ruby-based programs like Jekyll. Ruby is installed on the Mac by default, but you must add it to Windows.

## How 'deep' should I sequence each sample?

Ruby has a number of plugins referred to as "gems." Just because you have Ruby doesn't mean you have all the necessary Ruby gems that your program needs to run. Gems provide additional functionality for Ruby programs. There are thousands of [Rubygems](https://rubygems.org/) available for you to use.

## Single-end or paired-end?

After Bundler retrieves and installs the gems, it makes a detailed list of all the gems and versions it has installed for your project. The snapshot of all gems + versions installed is stored in your Gemfile.lock file, which might look like this:

## How many replicates should I have?

[Bundler](http://bundler.io/) is a gem package manager for Ruby, which means it goes out and gets all the gems you need for your Ruby programs. If you tell Bundler you need the [jekyll gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll), it will retrieve all the dependencies on the jekyll gem as well -- automatically.

## How much will it cost?

[Bundler](http://bundler.io/) is a gem package manager for Ruby, which means it goes out and gets all the gems you need for your Ruby programs. If you tell Bundler you need the [jekyll gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll), it will retrieve all the dependencies on the jekyll gem as well -- automatically.

## How long will it take?

[Bundler](http://bundler.io/) is a gem package manager for Ruby, which means it goes out and gets all the gems you need for your Ruby programs. If you tell Bundler you need the [jekyll gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll), it will retrieve all the dependencies on the jekyll gem as well -- automatically.

## So I can just give you my samples then?

[Bundler](http://bundler.io/) is a gem package manager for Ruby, which means it goes out and gets all the gems you need for your Ruby programs. If you tell Bundler you need the [jekyll gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll), it will retrieve all the dependencies on the jekyll gem as well -- automatically.
